        <h3>Biogas Production</h3>
        <p>At MethBio, we use a process called anaerobic digestion to produce biogas from cow manure. Anaerobic digestion is a natural process in which microorganisms break down organic matter in the absence of oxygen. We use a specially designed digester to optimize this process and extract as much biogas as possible.</p>

        <h3>Biogas Upgrading</h3>
        <p>The biogas produced from the anaerobic digestion process contains impurities such as carbon dioxide and water vapor. In order to make the biogas usable as a fuel, we use a process called biogas upgrading to remove these impurities. This results in a high-quality biomethane fuel that can be used to power vehicles, heat buildings, and generate electricity.</p>

        <h3>Biogas Utilization</h3>
        <p>There are many ways to use biogas, depending on the specific needs of our customers. Some of the most common applications include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Vehicle fuel: Biomethane can be used as a replacement for gasoline or diesel in vehicles.</li>
          <li>Heat and power: Biomethane can be used to generate heat and electricity for homes, businesses, and farms.</li>
          <li>Fertilizer: The leftover digestate from the anaerobic digestion process can be used as a nutrient-rich fertilizer for crops.</li>
        </ul>
